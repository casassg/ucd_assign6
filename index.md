## The prototype

In order to simulate a web enviroment as well as possible I decided to go with [Figma](figma.com) for the prototype. To simulate interactions I linked buttons to generated screens to give the user a feeling that he can interact with the system. 

<button style="text-align:center;" name="button" onclick="https://www.figma.com/file/PrjeiH5pAaFcIQtlmKck5hcz/HackX-Registration">Open prototype in Figma</button>
