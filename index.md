## The prototype

In order to simulate a web enviroment as well as possible I decided to go with [Figma](figma.com) for the prototype. To simulate interactions I linked buttons to generated screens to give the user a feeling that he can interact with the system.

### How to build it

To build the prototype and recreate it you need to download the images. To simulate interaction you can see the connections here:

The best way to reproduce this would be to print this images and use a **Wizard of Oz** tecnique to simulate the interactions. 


## Prototype changes

This are the changes that I introduced 

| Feedback from first prototype       | New prototype           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Application status is not obvious      | right-aligned | 
| Difficult to understand team list order    | centered      |   
| Team comment and contact together can be confusing | are neat      |    
| Public/Private team difficult to see | are neat      |    
| Submit application button text is confusing |  |
